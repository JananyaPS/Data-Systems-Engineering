# Relational Query Engineering (PostgreSQL)

## Overview
This project focuses on **relational database design and query optimization**
using PostgreSQL. It demonstrates how careful schema modeling, constraints, and
query planning directly impact performance and correctness in data-intensive
systems.

The work emphasizes practical database engineering concepts rather than
theoretical SQL usage, reflecting how relational systems are designed and
optimized in production environments.

## Objectives
- Design a normalized relational schema from raw datasets
- Enforce data integrity using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
- Execute complex analytical SQL queries efficiently
- Understand query execution behavior and optimization trade-offs

## Key Features
- **Schema Design**: Well-structured tables with explicit relationships
- **Data Integrity**: Primary keys, foreign keys, and cascading constraints
- **Query Optimization**: Performance-aware SQL queries over large tables
- **Automation**: Shell script to initialize schema, load data, and run queries
