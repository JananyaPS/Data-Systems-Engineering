# Data Systems Engineering

A curated portfolio of data systems projects focused on **performance-aware design,
scalability, and real-world data processing**.  
These projects explore how modern data platforms are built—from relational query
optimization to distributed analytics and storage-engine internals.

The repository demonstrates hands-on experience with **database design, query
execution, distributed computation, spatial analytics, and NoSQL storage systems**,
using industry-relevant tools and frameworks.

## Projects

### Relational Query Engineering
Design and optimization of a relational database using PostgreSQL, emphasizing
schema modeling, relationships, constraints, and efficient query execution.
The project highlights practical aspects of SQL performance tuning and data
organization.

### Spark Spatial Analytics
Implementation of distributed spatial queries using Apache Spark and SparkSQL.
Includes range queries, distance queries, and spatial joins implemented through
custom UDFs, showcasing scalable geospatial data processing.

### Spatiotemporal Gi* Hotspots
A distributed spatiotemporal hotspot detection pipeline using Apache Spark.
The project applies the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic over space-time grids to identify
statistically significant activity clusters at scale.

### Embedded NoSQL Storage (RocksDB)
A C++-based embedded key-value storage layer built on RocksDB.
Demonstrates core NoSQL storage concepts such as batch ingestion, multi-key
retrieval, range scans, and persistent data management using an LSM-tree
architecture.
